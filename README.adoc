= Node Express.js Sequelize Example Realworld App

== Local development with SQLite

.....
npm install
npm run dev
.....

The browser automatically pops the development front-end server at http://localhost:4101/[].

== Local optimized frontend

.....
npm install
npm run build
npm start
.....

The website can not be seen at: http://localhost:3000/

This setup does not start the front-end development server at http://localhost:4101/[], but rather compiles the front-end files statically, and serves them on the public folder of the backend server.

This is the type of setup that will run in production, with a single server. Running it locally might help debug some front-end deployment issues. But otherwise you will just normally use the <<local-development-with-sqlite>> setup instead for devlopment.

== Heroku deployment

....
# Automatically sets DATABASE_URL.
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
# Otherwise the react build picks up the .eslint from this directory,
# which specifies a plugin that is not installed because it is in the
# devDependencies of this package.json... For the love of God, this is
# a deployment, not a CI.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55821078/disable-eslint-that-create-react-app-provides
heroku config:set DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
# Notably to skip ultra-slow sqlite native build.
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=true YARN_PRODUCTION=true
heroku config:set SECRET="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 256)"
git push heroku master
